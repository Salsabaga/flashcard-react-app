# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Flashcards Made with React

### Flashcards V1

This project was built with the knowledge of creating a Notes app from Udemy Courses. Utitlising my knowledge of passing props, managing components and using the spread operator to handle a value change of an input, to further expand the my expertise in React by creating a flashcard app that creates a flashcard used for translation that I have also been practicing, a attempt of recreating Quizlet but at its basic foundation.

#### New ideas

While learning of the many functions required to add and delete notes/data, I also added in form validation in order for users not to pass in blank data into the form, as well as keeping the value of the input in either input boxes rather than resetting the values all together. In addition, some clients/users who would be studying a language such as japanese, mandarin or even Arabic would have some trouble typing out the letters since their keyboard suited for the language they want to use is not enabled and would have to go and install it. I had provided an alternative, should they need to, of enabling a keyboard containing all the hiragana characters so users can input the letters of their word inside the translation input area. Other languages will be coming soon but I would also put an alert/modal encouraging users to install a new keyboard from their OS.
